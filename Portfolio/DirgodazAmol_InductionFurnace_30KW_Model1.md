## Induction Furnace, 30KW

Feathres:
- 3-Phase
- Half-Bridge with IGBT
- Power Controller with 3-Phase Full Wave Rectifier with Half Controlled

Client from [Dirgodaz Amol Industries Inc., Iran](https://dirgodazamol.com/en/)  
Work type was on-site  
Mar 2018 - Sep 2018  
  
Note: It was a prototype.  
Note: In this project, we did not design a new board. We remade all boards of the 50 KW induction furnace for for this model.  

My Tasks :
- PCB assembly of these boards
  - 3-Phase Full Wave Rectifier with Half Controlled Based on AVR MCU
  - [DC Motor Driver, Full Bridge with MOSFET, Isolated, 12V/5A](https://github.com/AliRezaJoodi/AliRezaJoodi/blob/main/Portfolio/DirgodazAmol_DcMotorDriver_FullBridge_Isolated_12V5A.md)
  - Isolated Measurement of Voltage and Current with THD Components
  - A board with multiple power supplies 
  - Controller Board base on AVR MCU
  - Display Panel with 20×4 Character LCD
  - Capacitor packages
- Electrical components installing
- Installed the cooling components
- Wiring
